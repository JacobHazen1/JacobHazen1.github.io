          Jacob Hazen is currently a Ph.D. Candidate in Economics at McGill University. He holds an MA in Economics and
          Data Science from Carleton University, and a BA in Economics and Computer Science from the University of
          Calgary. He is a recipient of the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council (SSHRC) Doctoral
          Fellowship.
          <br /><br />
          Prior to his doctoral studies, Jacob worked in both the private and public sectors, focusing on
          Natural Language Processing (NLP) projects. His research explores the intersections of Economics, Data
          Science, and Computer Science, with a particular emphasis on the applications of NLP in economic contexts.
          <br /><br />
          His research interests span applied microeconomics, labor economics, applied econometrics, child development,
          and education.
          <br /><br />
          Outside of his studies, Jacob enjoys spending most of his time outdoors. In the winter, he is a frequent
          hockey player, and during the warmer months, he enjoys skateboarding. He was also a competitive skateboarder
          before beginning his studies. Below, you can view a gallery of past photos of him.

                  Temporary abstract text. This is a working paper, and the abstract will be updated in the future.
                  This paper develops a structural model of household decision-making to study how parental time
                  allocation, wage risk, and tax-and-transfer policies shape the socio-emotional skill formation of
                  children. I introduce parental bond—a composite measure of parenting behaviours, emotional warmth,
                  consistency, and inter-parental functioning—as a key input in the production of socio-emotional
                  skills.
                  In the model, households allocate time across work, leisure, and childcare under income shocks, which
                  affects the parental bond and, in turn, children’s skill development. I examine how idiosyncratic wage
                  risk and progressive tax policies alter these dynamics. This framework bridges the economics of
                  parenting, household behaviour, and skill formation literatures by formalizing how economic conditions
                  and intra-household decisions interact with relational aspects of parenting. The paper is, to my
                  knowledge, the first to endogenize parental bond within a dynamic household model and explore its role
                  in
                  the development of children’s socio-emotional skills.

                  This study examines the process of how socio-emotional skills in children evolve and how they
                  predict adult outcomes. Using Canadian data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Children and
                  Youth (NLSCY), this research estimates production functions of socio-emotional skills. Using recent
                  advances in Latent Factor Analysis, I find a five factor model representation of socio-emotional
                  skills,
                  attention, conduct, prosocial, emotional, and malice problems. I find that these skills are shown to
                  be increasingly self-productive as child ages and that parental investment are larger for these skills
                  at
                  earlier ages. Next, using income data from their tax files in adulthood, I show that children that
                  have
                  higher levels of malice problems suggest a 4% increase in earnings.

                  In this paper, we analyze persistent inequality in maternal mental health by examining whether
                  and how mothers’ latent mental health can be compared across different stages of motherhood
                  for different groups. We introduce a measurement model for binary mental health indicators that
                  draws on multiple measures across survey rounds, establishing identification conditions for valid
                  cross-group and longitudinal comparisons. We implement this framework using rich longitudinal
                  data from Peru (Young Lives Study), covering mothers’ mental health over a fifteen-year period
                  and study inequality in mental health across Indigenous and non-Indigenous mothers. We find
                  that mental health measures exhibit strict measurement invariance, enabling direct comparisons
                  across groups and over time. Our results reveal that while both Indigenous and non-Indigenous
                  mothers experience improvements in mental health after the postpartum period, the gains are
                  substantially larger for non-Indigenous mothers, leading to widening disparities as children age.
                  We show that differences in educational attainment and family composition explain most of the
                  initial gap in mental health, but early postpartum mental health becomes increasingly important
                  in driving persistent inequality through children’s adolescence.

                <p>
                  The post-pandemic labour market has been tight, with widespread labour shortages across sectors and
                  industries. Employers have a range of strategies for attracting and retaining workers in a
                  more-competitive labour market, including raising wages, offering more benefits and lowering skill,
                  education and experience requirements.

                  This project used Canadian job ads to understand changes in the terms of employment offered to job
                  seekers, focusing specifically on skill, education, and experience requirements, as well as job
                  benefits, between the two-year period prior to the pandemic (2017-2019) and 2022.

                  The project found that there had been no increase in wages in the five-year period, but that wages
                  were more likely to be posted in job ads in 2022 than in the period prior to the pandemic. An
                  increasing proportion of job ads included skill requirements, especially soft skills, and more
                  included education and experience requirements. But the educational and experience requirements have
                  become less demanding, requiring less education and fewer years of experience. The research also found
                  that an increasing proportion of job postings include non-wage benefits, compensation-linked benefits
                  for lower-wage jobs, and flexibility and time off benefits for higher-wage jobs.

                  The findings from this project suggest that employers are increasingly competing for low-wage workers
                  and that the primary method being used to attract talent is improving benefits. This bodes well for
                  the quality of work for those in low-wage positions, but questions remain about the ability of
                  employers to offer higher wages for these in-demand roles.
