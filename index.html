          Jacob Hazen is currently a Ph.D. Candidate in Economics at McGill University. He holds an MA in Economics and
          Data Science from Carleton University, and a BA in Economics and Computer Science from the University of
          Calgary. Prior to his doctoral studies, Jacob worked in both the private and public sectors, focusing on
          Natural Language Processing (NLP) projects. His research explores the intersections of Economics, Data
          Science, and Computer Science, with a particular emphasis on the applications of NLP in economic contexts.
          <br /><br />
          His research interests span applied microeconomics, labor economics, applied econometrics, child development,
          and education.
          <br /><br />
          Outside of his studies, Jacob enjoys spending most of his time outdoors. In the winter, he is a frequent
          hockey player, and during the warmer months, he enjoys skateboarding. He was also a competitive skateboarder
          before beginning his studies. Below, you can view a gallery of past photos of him.

            Temporary abstract text. This is a working paper, and the abstract will be updated in the future.
            This paper develops a structural model of household decision-making to study how parental time
            allocation, wage risk, and tax-and-transfer policies shape the socio-emotional skill formation of chil-
            dren. I introduce parental bond—a composite measure of parenting behaviours, emotional warmth,
            consistency, and inter-parental functioning—as a key input in the production of socio-emotional skills.
            In the model, households allocate time across work, leisure, and childcare under income shocks, which
            affects the parental bond and, in turn, children’s skill development. I examine how idiosyncratic wage
            risk and progressive tax policies alter these dynamics. This framework bridges the economics of par-
            enting, household behaviour, and skill formation literatures by formalizing how economic conditions
            and intra-household decisions interact with relational aspects of parenting. The paper is, to my knowl-
            edge, the first to endogenize parental bond within a dynamic household model and explore its role in
            the development of children’s socio-emotional skills

              This study examines the process of how socio-emotional skills in children evolve and how they
              predict adult outcomes. Using Canadian data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Children and
              Youth (NLSCY), this research estimates production functions of socio-emotional skills. Using recent
              advances in Latent Factor Analysis, I find a five factor model representation of socio-emotional skills,
              attention, conduct, prosocial, emotional, and malice problems. I find that these skills are shown to
              be increasingly self-productive as child ages and that parental investment are larger for these skills at
              earlier ages. Next, using income data from their tax files in adulthood, I show that children that have
              higher levels of malice problems suggest a 4% increase in earnings.

              In this paper, we analyze persistent inequality in maternal mental health by examining whether
              and how mothers’ latent mental health can be compared across different stages of motherhood
              for different groups. We introduce a measurement model for binary mental health indicators that
              draws on multiple measures across survey rounds, establishing identification conditions for valid
              cross-group and longitudinal comparisons. We implement this framework using rich longitudinal
              data from Peru (Young Lives Study), covering mothers’ mental health over a fifteen-year period
              and study inequality in mental health across Indigenous and non-Indigenous mothers. We find
              that mental health measures exhibit strict measurement invariance, enabling direct comparisons
              across groups and over time. Our results reveal that while both Indigenous and non-Indigenous
              mothers experience improvements in mental health after the postpartum period, the gains are
              substantially larger for non-Indigenous mothers, leading to widening disparities as children age.
              We show that differences in educational attainment and family composition explain most of the
              initial gap in mental health, but early postpartum mental health becomes increasingly important
              in driving persistent inequality through children’s adolescence.

            <p>
The post-pandemic labour market has been tight, with widespread labour shortages across sectors and industries. Employers have a range of strategies for attracting and retaining workers in a more-competitive labour market, including raising wages, offering more benefits and lowering skill, education and experience requirements. 

This project used Canadian job ads to understand changes in the terms of employment offered to job seekers, focusing specifically on skill, education, and experience requirements, as well as job benefits, between the two-year period prior to the pandemic (2017-2019) and 2022.

The project found that there had been no increase in wages in the five-year period, but that wages were more likely to be posted in job ads in 2022 than in the period prior to the pandemic. An increasing proportion of job ads included skill requirements, especially soft skills, and more included education and experience requirements. But the educational and experience requirements have become less demanding, requiring less education and fewer years of experience. The research also found that an increasing proportion of job postings include non-wage benefits, compensation-linked benefits for lower-wage jobs, and flexibility and time off benefits for higher-wage jobs. 

The findings from this project suggest that employers are increasingly competing for low-wage workers and that the primary method being used to attract talent is improving benefits. This bodes well for the quality of work for those in low-wage positions, but questions remain about the ability of employers to offer higher wages for these in-demand roles.

        I love hockey. I used to play and even lived in Salt Lake City for a year to pursue it. I could talk about
        hockey for hours and never get bored. Despite having played at a high level, I’m part of a fantasy hockey league
        that’s been running for six years, and amusingly, none of the other members know how to skate — yet, I somehow
        finish last every year.
